[![Setup Brisk](https://github.com/brisktest/setup-brisk/actions/workflows/setup-brisk.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/brisktest/setup-brisk/actions/workflows/setup-brisk.yml)

The `brisktest/setup-brisk` action is a JavaScript action that sets up Brisk CLI in your GitHub Actions workflow by:

- Downloading a specific version of Brisk CLI and adding it to the `PATH`.
- Configuring the environment with env vars to configure your run such as api tokens and keys and project files.

After you've used the action, subsequent steps in the same job can run arbitrary Brisk commands using [the GitHub Actions `run` syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsrun). This allows most Brisk commands to work exactly like they do on your local command line.

## Usage

This action can be run on `ubuntu-latest` and `macos-latest` GitHub Actions runners.

The default configuration installs the latest version of Brisk CLI

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: brisktest/setup-brisk@v1
```

A specific version of Brisk CLI can be installed:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: brisktest/setup-brisk@v1
    with:
      brisk_version: 0.1.25
```

Credentials for Brisk ([brisktest.com](https://brisktest.com/)) can be configured:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: brisktest/setup-brisk@v1
    with:
      api_token: ${{ secrets.BRISK_TOKEN }}
      api_key: ${{ secrets.BRISK_API_KEY }}
```

- `brisk_version` - (optional) The version of Brisk CLI to install. Defaults to latest or you can use a version string like 0.1.25
